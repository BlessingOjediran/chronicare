                                    <p>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is an autoimmune disease caused when your immune system attacks the cells (Beta cells) in your pancreas that make insulin. Persons with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin to replace what the body can no longer make. Although, it usually appears during childhood or adolescents, it can develop in adults.
                                    </p>       
                                    <p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is the type usually found in adults. Family history, weight gain, lack of physical activity and stress can increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Here, insulin is produced by the pancreas but it is not adequate or your body does not use it well. The cells in your body become “resistant” , making your pancreas work harder to keep blood sugar levels normal. Although it can be managed through healthier eating, exercise and weight loss, eventually most people who have diabetes will need medication to bring their glucose down to their target level. There is no permanent cure but it can be managed effectively.

                                    <p>Diabetes can harm your eyes. It can damage the small blood vessels in the retina which is the back part of the eye. This is called diabetic retinopathy. Diabetes also increases your risk of having glaucoma, cataracts and other eye problems that could lead to vision loss. If you have diabetes, you need to work with your doctor and undergo regular eye examinations to ensure proper eye care.</p>       
                                    <p>Poor blood sugar control can lead to diabetes retinopathy. This is a complication caused by high blood sugar levels that can damage the back of the eyes. It can lead to blindness if left undiagnosed or untreated. It is therefore important that people living with diabetes carry out a mandatory annual eye screening.

                                    <p>One of the risk factors of high blood sugar levels is diabetes neuropathy. The condition most often affects the legs and feet due to nerve damage caused by high blood glucose. For some people, symptoms are mild or numbness of the feet. For others, symptoms can be painful, debilitating and even fatal. This is due to the damage to the nerves.</p>   
                                    <p>Proper foot monitoring can reduce your chances of developing foot conditions that may result in serious complications. We offer annual foot evaluation and teach patients how to carry out daily self-examination.</p>

                            <p>"I am a long-term diabetic patient, currently being managed by Chronicare. My consultation with them is very personal, the doctor and nurses are efficient, know their jobs and they are friendly. The after services are top notch as they get in touch via phone and WhatsApp to know how I am faring. Since I started my management plan with them my blood sugar levels have gone down from very high to pre level because I follow their expert advice. I have a management plan with them that makes it cost effective to access doctors or nurses and some needed accessories at reduced prices instead of the one-off visits. The plan also gives me the opportunity to see an ophthalmologist for eye check and personal meal plan by the dietician. They also organize regular webinars on management and the opportunity to learn from others living with the same experience. When you want the best management in Diabetes, think of Chronicare services, efficient, affordable, and pocket friendly."</p>
